# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input or missing resources. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

The bug involves accessing user data based on an ID provided in the request parameters.  The original code lacks error handling for scenarios where the user ID is invalid or the user is not found. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

The solution adds comprehensive error handling, including checks for invalid input and appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate failure.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Send a GET request to `/users/{invalid_id}`, where `{invalid_id}` is not a valid user ID. Observe the lack of a proper error response.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` and repeat step 4. Observe the proper error response (404 Not Found).
